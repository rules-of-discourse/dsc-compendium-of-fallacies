<h2 id="top_of_page">The Cogencies</h2>

<p>
A fallacy is an a logically sound pattern of reasoning.
</p>

<p>
It should be noted that in the Rules of Discourse,
the term "fallacy" and "cogency" are not used to refer to specific
arguments, but to patterns within arguments.
The arguments themselves are not the fallacies and cogencies
themselves, but involve uses and/or instances of the fallacies
and cogencies.
This distinction must be kept in mind for the sake of exactness.
