<h2 id="top_of_page">The Malconducts</h2>

<p>
The malconducts are conducts or behaviors
that are anticonducive to proper discourse,
and which the Rules of Discourse therefore
instruct participants to avoid.
</p>

<p>
A malconduct is different from a fallacy
in that a fallacy is a pattern of argument
while a malconduct is a pattern of action.
The use of a fallacy automatically qualifies
as a malconduct, however there are some
malconducts for which a fallacy can not be
specifically named.
</p>

<p>
Traditional compendia of fallacies do not
contain specific sections for malconducts.
This is problematic.
This has resulted in some malconducts
(such as the Appeal to Force Malconduct)
being listed as fallacies when in reality
they are more accurately classified as malconducts.
It has also resulted in other malconducts such
as the <a href = "mal-homework_malconduct.xhtml">Homework Malconduct</a>
being left out altogether.
