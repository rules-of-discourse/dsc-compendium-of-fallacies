<h2 id="top_of_page">The Bonconducts</h2>

<p>
The bonconducts are conducts or behaviors
that are conducive to proper discourse,
and which the Rules of Discourse therefore
smile upon.
</p>

<p>
It should be noted that
<span class = "crucial">the distinction between
malconducts and bonconducts is not about social etiquette</span>.
<span class = "crucial">Social etiquette is not what is at stake
if malconducts are permitted - nor is social etiquette the criterion
for determining whether something is a malconduct or a
bonconduct.
This is squarely about assuring as well as possible an
environment of proper discourse based on reason and
comprehensive logic.</span>
