# Some Coding Standards

This document is labeled "Some Coding Standards" because
there is no guarantee that the coding standards in this
document are full and comprehensive. It is merely an
"as well\-defined as possible" guide that is subject to
improvement over time.

## Source\-Code Standards

Any contribution that causes the ebook or the web\-site
to fail to build or render correctly _will_ be rejected.
The administration of this project may choose to repair
a contribution that fails this criterion rather than
reject it outright \- but is not obligated to do so
and (unless specifically stated otherwise) makes
no promise to do so.

Contributions that restrict themselves to editing
the in-category entries (and as few of them as possible)
are more likely to be accepted than contributions that
wander outside this scope.

### XHTML File Naming Convention

The XHTML files that are pages in this document's
output ebook are all found inside the "Text" directory.
The filename of the main-page of a caegory is to begin
with the string "__gnr\-\-__" followed by the three-letter
code of the category, followed by the extension string "__.xhtml__".

The name of an in-category entry is to begin with the three-letter
code of the category - followed by a hyphen ("__\-__") followed
by a specific notation of the name of whatever the entry is about
(the same as the in\-XHTML title of the entry) followed
by the extension string "__.xhtml__".

The notation of a page's title that will be incorporated into
the filename is as follows: Take the full title, make all
the letters lowercase, replace all whitespaces with underscores
leave all hyphens as-is,
and remove all other punctuations (such as and apostraphes).
If anything about this description is unclear, feel free to
look at the example of the entries that already exist.

### Format of the XHMTL files.

Treat the existing entries as examples of how these XHTML
files are to be formatted.
To make your job easier, in many cases there may be
pre-existing templates that you can copy.

## Linguistic Standards

Obviously, the language of this authoritative edition of the
compendium is English. Both of the licenses under which the
XHTML files are licensed under provide means by which you
can legally make and release translations \- but contributions
to the main document must be in English.

### Gendered Language

Only use gender-specific pronouns in cases where you are
referring to someone who can only be of the gender who's
pronouns you are using.

Avoid using singular "they", especially in situations where
doing such can be confusing and/or awkward \- but try
concertedly to altogether reserve "they" for the plural.
While there exists precedent in the English language
for using singluar "they" \- that tradition for most
of it's history tended to reserve singular "they" to
situations in which the context differentiated it very
clearly from the actual plural usage of the term.
It was a tradition that well-suited people who were
comfortable restricting gender-neutral pronouns to
situations in which they could use "they" without causing
such confusion \- because in those days, people didn't
hesitate to make gender\-assumption (usually the assumption
of maleness) in situations where use of singular "they"
could realistically be confused with the plural.

When referring to a singular\-yet\-indefinite person who could
be of any gender \- use the zie\-based pronouns as defined
in the following table:

Male pronoun | Female pronoun | Gender\-ambiguous pronoun
--- | --- | ---
he | she | zie
him | her | zim
his | her | zir
his | hers | zirs
himself | herself | zimself
