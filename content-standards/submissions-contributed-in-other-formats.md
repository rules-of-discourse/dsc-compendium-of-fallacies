# On Submissions Contributed in Other Formats

## Offering contributions not in XHTML

If you have a contribution to offer, but are not
up to the task of creating and properly formatting
an XHTML file so that it will fit into the
ebook and web-stie, the following alternate
option is available.

Offer your submission in the form of a plain-text
document (extension __.txt__)
and place it in the directory named __txt-contrib__
in the repository's main directory
(instead of the directory labeled __Text__).

DON'T ANYONE MESS WITH THE __main.html__ FILE
INSIDE THE __txt-contrib__ DIRECTORY - AS IT
IS THERE FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE REPOSITORY'S
INTEGRITY.

Entries present in such a manner don't get 
included in the ebook or in the web-site.
However, their presence there in that
format allows for
the possibility of another project contributor
later on converting them to XHTML and placing
them in such a place that they _will_ get
into these editions.
