## Incompelete Entries

In the [main content-standards document](main.md) it is described how to
flag incomplete entries so that they will not appear
in production-ready editions of the Compendium.

This section, however, is to explain _some_ of the _situations_
in which this is the appropriate thing to do.

### Fallacy entries without the razors worked out

This criterion applies only to entries that describe fallacies.
Malconducts, while it is still preferred that they have reazors,
are exempt from them being a prerequisite for the flag of
incompletion being lifted.

The reason for this is that unlike with malconducts,
there are plenty of compendiums already out there that
cover fallacies.
As far as fallacies are concerned, therefore, the
importance of having razors is what sets this compendium
apart from others.
Therefore, entries on fallacies should not be included
in the production-ready editions of the compendium
unless the razors are worked out.

Malconducts, on the other hand, can be included in
the production-ready editions even if their razors are
not worked out yet - because malconducts (unlike fallacies)
are things that most pre-existing compendiums have
tended to neglect.

### Entries that are just not ready to be worth including

If an entry is so imcomplete that it's presence doesn't
add value to the compendium, but still should be in the
project files in hopes of eventual completion,
then it obviously should be included in development-oriented
editions of the compendium, but not in production-ready
editions.

However - rarely will you have enough knowledge to
put together any entry worth contributing at all that is too
incomplete on this count without it _also_ being too
incomplete on one of the more _specific_ counts.
