## Gendered Language

Only use gender-specific pronouns in cases where you are
referring to someone who can only be of the gender who's
pronouns you are using.

Avoid using singular "they", especially in situations where
doing such can be confusing and/or awkward \- but try
concertedly to altogether reserve "they" for the plural.
While there exists precedent in the English language
for using singluar "they" \- that tradition for most
of it's history tended to reserve singular "they" to
situations in which the context differentiated it very
clearly from the actual plural usage of the term.
It was a tradition that well-suited people who were
comfortable restricting gender-neutral pronouns to
situations in which they could use "they" without causing
such confusion \- because in those days, people didn't
hesitate to make gender\-assumption (usually the assumption
of maleness) in situations where use of singular "they"
could realistically be confused with the plural.

When referring to a singular\-yet\-indefinite person who could
be of any gender \- use the zie\-based pronouns as defined
in the following table:

Male pronoun | Female pronoun | Gender\-ambiguous pronoun
--- | --- | ---
he | she | zie
him | her | zim
his | her | zir
his | hers | zirs
himself | herself | zimself
