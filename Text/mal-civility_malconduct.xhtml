<h4>Basic Description</h4>

<p>
The Civility Malconduct is when a rule of social
etiquette or some other standard of civility is
enforced at the expense of the integrity of the
discourse itself.
</p>

<p>
This malconduct does not apply to all enforcement
of standards of decorum. It merely applies to
cases in which such enforcement is done at the expense
of the integrity to discourse itself or with
disregard as to whether or not it could obstruct
discourse.
Politeness and civility are both good things.
They merely should not be prioritized over
integrity of discourse.
</p>

<p>
This malconduct applies whether the enforcement is
done by means of administrative authority, peer pressure,
or any other means of enforcement.
</p>

<p>
The fine\-points of this malconduct have not yet
been worked out \- and it may, in the end, even
turn out to be a category of malconducts rather
than a singular malconduct.
