<h4>Basic Description</h4>

<p>
The Homework Malconduct is committed by a participant in the discussion
(Person A) when zie attempts to assign another participant (Person B)
the task of researching evidence and arguments that it is in fact
Person A's job to present.
</p>

<h4>Razors</h4>

<p>
If Person A cites external material as the source of
an argument provided, that does not qualify as an
instance of the Homework Malconduct - provided that
the following criteria are met:
</p>

<div class = "bullet">
Zie is exact as possible where in the external
material Person B needs to look to find the
source of the argument.
</div>

<div class = "bullet">

<span class = "emp">addition</span> to
providing the argument in the discourse itself -

</div>

<p>

as an instance of the Homework Malconduct
when it is properly an execution of the
Homework Against Repetition Bonconduct,
which is often the proper response
to the <a href = "mal-exhausting_repetition_malconduct.xhtml">Exhausting Repetition Malconduct</a>.
