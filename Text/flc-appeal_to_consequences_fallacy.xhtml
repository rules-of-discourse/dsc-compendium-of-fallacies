<h4>Basic Description</h4>

<p>
The Appeal to Consequences fallacy is when one proposition is rejected
because of what it would imply - even though what it would imply
hasn't been properly ruled out.

<h4>Razors</h4>

<div class = "rzstep" id = "ts01s01x">
<div class = "rzs_head">
Step 1
</div>
<div class = "rzs_body">
Is the person suspected of committing the fallacy
<span class = "lbset">Person A</span>
claiming that one proposition <span class = "lbset">Proposition B</span>
can not be true because it would mean that a certain other proposition
<span class = "lbset">Proposition C</span> must also be true?
</div>
<div class = "rzs_ans">
<div class = "rzs_if">
If the answer is "yes"
</div>
<div class = "rzs_then">
<a href = "#ts01s02x">Proceed to Step 2</a>

<div class = "rzs_ans">
<div class = "rzs_if">
If the answer is "no"

<div class = "rzs_then">
In the clear.
This argument doesn't even have the most
rudimentary form of the fallacy in question.

Step 2

<div class = "rzs_body">
Has it been properly established that
<span class = "lbuse">Proposition C</span> is not true?

<div class = "rzs_ans">
<div class = "rzs_if">
If the answer is "yes"
</div>
<div class = "rzs_then">
In the clear.
This is the cogent form of an inverse proof.

<div class = "rzs_if">
