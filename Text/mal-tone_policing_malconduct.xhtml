<h3 id = "top_of_page">Tone Policing Malconduct</h3>

<div class = "navbar"><a href = "gnr--mal.xhtml">Malconducts</a></div>


<h4>Basic Description</h4>

<p>
This malconduct is committed when relevant and
potentially sound argument is silenced on the
basis of real or alleged lack of decorum in
the presentation of said argumentation.
It is a subtype of the
<a href = "mal-civility_malconduct.xhtml">Civility Malconduct</a>.
</p>

<h4>Subtleties</h4>

<p>
The Tone Policing malconduct is a very complex malconduct.
For this reason, developing systematic razors for
distinguishing it from it's faux forms.
That said, until such razors are developed, it is
nonetheless necessary to provide what guidelines
can be provided for such distinction - as it
is necessary to prevent provisions against this
malconduct from being abused by promoters of
truly illegitimate argument
without allowing bona-fide cases of this malconduct
to slip through the cracks.
</p>

<p>
As such, the only thing that can be done is to
describe the malconduct, as well as the dynamic
that it is part of, as clearly as possible - in
hopes that such a description can be used as
a standard against which cases suspected of
this malconduct can be tested.
