<div class = "navbar"><a href = "gnr--mal.xhtml">Malconducts</a></div>


<h4>Basic Description</h4>

<p>
This malconduct is committed when relevant and
potentially sound argument is silenced on the
basis of real or alleged lack of decorum in
the presentation of said argumentation.
It is a subtype of the
<a href = "mal-civility_malconduct.xhtml">Civility Malconduct</a>.
</p>

<h4>Razors Needed</h4>

<p>
Razors are essential in defining this malconduct,
as abence of proper razors elevate the risk of
either (a) failure to adequately prevent this
malconduct or (b) abuse of precautions against
this malconduct by promoters of illegitimate
argument that truly violates sound discourse
and rightly should be halted.
</p>

<p>
That said - the desining of such razors is
easier said than done - as this malconduct
is an extremely complex one.
The following Razors should therefore be
regarded as being in early development.
