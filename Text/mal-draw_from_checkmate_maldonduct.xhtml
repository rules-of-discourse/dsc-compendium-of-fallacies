<h4>Basic Description</h4>

<p>
The Draw from Checkmate is a subtype of Pigeon Chess
in which one participant in the discussion (Person A)
who is in fact committing the Pidgeon Chess malconduct
attempts to extract zirself from the discussion in
a way that makes it seem as though zir opponent (Person B)
is the one committing the Pidgeon Chess malconduct.
An instance of the Draw from Checkmate malconduct
is known as a Draw from Chechmate.
</p>

<p>
The Draw from Checkmate malconduct is named such
because when someone commits a Draw from Checkmate,
it is analogous to if Person A is playing chess
against an oponent (Person B) - and as soon
as Person B successfully had checkmated Person A's
king, Person A had gotten up and left, claiming
that the game was a draw.
