<h4>Basic Description</h4>

<p>
This malconduct covers any effort in debate
or other communication to induce fallacious
thought in the audience.
</p>

<p>
When you use fallacies in your thought, that
alone is undesirable.
But the moment you incorporate those fallacies
into your debate arguments or other communications,
it also becomes a malconduct - this malconduct.
