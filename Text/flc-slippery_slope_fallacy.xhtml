<h4>Basic Description</h4>

<p>
The Slippery Slope fallacy is when a course of action (or inaction)
is objected to on the grounds that it would lead to a specific
result despite the lack of a sound basis for the conclusion
that it really would lead to that undesired result.
</p>

<h4>Razors</h4>

<div class = "rzstep" id = "ts01s01x">
<div class = "rzs_head">
Step 1
</div>
<div class = "rzs_body">
Is the argument that a particular course of action
or inaction <span class = "lbset">Course A</span>
should not be used because it would lead to
a particular result <span class = "lbset">Situation B</span>?
</div>
<div class = "rzs_ans">
<div class = "rzs_if">
If the answer is "yes"
</div>
<div class = "rzs_then">
<a href = "#ts01s02x">Proceed to Step 2.</a>
</div>
</div>
<div class = "rzs_ans">
<div class = "rzs_if">
If the answer is "no"
</div>
<div class = "rzs_then">
As far as this particular fallacy is concerned, the
argument is in the clear.
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class = "rzstep" id = "ts01s02x">
<div class = "rzs_head">
Step 2
</div>
<div class = "rzs_body">
Do reason and evidence support the conclusion that
<span class = "lbuse">Course A</span>
would result in
<span class = "lbuse">Situation B</span>?
</div>
<div class = "rzs_ans">
<div class = "rzs_if">
If the answer is "yes"
</div>
<div class = "rzs_then">
The argument is in the clear.
</div>
</div>
<div class = "rzs_ans">
<div class = "rzs_if">
If the answer is "no"
</div>
<div class = "rzs_then">
In that case, yes, this is indeed
a case of the Slippery Slope fallacy.
