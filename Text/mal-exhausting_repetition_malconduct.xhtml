<h4>Basic Description</h4>

<p>
The Exhausting Repetition Malconduct
is when a flawed argument or group of flawed
arguments is brought forth with sufficient
frequency that the effort to rebut them
in kind would exert an undue strain on
those doing the rebutting.
Even though the flawed arguments can
all be successfully rebutted, the effort
to do so with excessive frequency results
in exhaustion.
This can have a number of possible problematic
end results.
</p>

<div class = "bullet">
Sometimes this exhaustion can even get
to the point of causing
the ones rebutting the flawed arguments
to give up, thereby rendering the illusion that
the flawed arguments have sufficed as proof.
</div>

<div class = "bullet">
The effort to rebut the repetitions of
the flawed arguments can divert effort that
is needed for other discussions.
</div>

<div class = "bullet">
When this malconduct is committed outside of
formal or otherwise formally designated meetings
of discourse, it can prevent the target of the
malconduct from being able to fully get on
with zir life by putting strain on zim to
re-address flawed arguments under the threat
of appearing unreasonable should zie decline
to do so.
</div>

<h4>Razors Needed</h4>

<p>
Razors are needed so as to prevent people from falsely
flagging this malconduct as a pretext to legitimizing
the <a href = "mal-homework_malconduct.xhtml">Homework Malconduct</a>.
