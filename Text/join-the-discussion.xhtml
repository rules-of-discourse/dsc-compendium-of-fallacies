<h2>Join the Discussion</h2>

<p>
This project can not move together at even a remotely reasonable pase
as long as only one person is working on it.
Very often it is difficult, if at all possible, to assure objectivity
of new entries if the authorship does not have anyone to discuss
the ideas with prior to entering them into this compendium.
</p>

<p>
For this reason, a discussion forum has been set up on Facebook.
Yes - Facebook is far from the ideal place to host this discussion,
but until a better alternative is available, it is better than nothing.
Please join the discussion group on Facebook (<a href = "https://www.facebook.com/groups/rules.of.discourse/" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener">https://www.facebook.com/groups/rules.of.discourse/</a>) where, by participating
in the discussions,
you will be providing this project with much-needed help.
</p>


<p>
Of course, the location of where this discussion is hosted may change.
For that reason, before you join the discussion forum, please
<a href = "http://compendium.rulesofdiscourse.org/Text/join-the-discussion.xhtml">check
the latest version of this page</a>
to make sure that your information on where the discussion is going
on is current.
